## 🧪 Next Steps

- To verify installation, open the included **demo map**:
  `Content/PlayerZeroSdk/Maps/PlayerZeroDemo.umap`
- Check the documentation below to learn how to load avatars and avatar renders.


## 🎮 Demo Map: Testing the PlayerZero SDK

The plugin includes a sample map that demonstrates the full PlayerZero avatar loading and image rendering pipeline.

---

### 📍 Location

You can find the demo map inside the Player Zero plugin folder under: `Content/PlayerZeroDemo.umap`.

---

### 🧪 How to Open the Demo

1. In the **Content Browser**, navigate to:  
   `Content > PlayerZeroSdk > Maps`

2. Double-click on `PlayerZeroDemo` to open the map.

---

### 🎭 Map Setup

<img width="1191" height="820" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-11 083436" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b05cdbb2-488f-481c-97c5-b42105c007f0" />


The map contains:

#### 🧱 `BP_PlayerZeroDemoActor`
- Found in the **World Outliner**
- Includes a `PlayerZeroLoaderComponent` which handles avatar loading
- In the Details panel, you can set:
    - `AvatarId`: Will auto-load the avatar on **BeginPlay**
    - `TargetSkeleton`: Optional skeleton for retargeting
    - `AnimationBlueprint`: Optional animation controller

---

### 🖼️ UI Widget: `WBP_PlayerZeroDemo`

- Automatically added to viewport in the **Level Blueprint**
- Contains:
    - `BP_AvatarCode` widget with a **text input field**
        - Input a shortcode and press Enter to fetch the corresponding avatar
    - **Avatar Image Preview**
        - Displays an avatar thumbnail loaded using the `LoadAvatarImageAsync` Blueprint node

---

### ✅ Testing the Demo

1. Press **Play** in the editor.
2. If `AvatarId` was set in `BP_PlayerZeroDemoActor`, an avatar should appear.
3. Test shortcode input:
    - Enter a valid **Avatar Code** into the input field
    - If successful, the avatar ID will be fetched and the avatar image will appear

---

### 💡 Pro Tip

You can extend the demo setup or use the `PlayerZeroLoaderComponent` and Blueprint nodes (`LoadAvatarImageAsync`) in your own UI or gameplay logic.

# Documentation
## 🎮 PlayerZeroLoaderComponent

The PlayerZeroLoaderComponent is a self-contained component that allows you to load a Ready Player Me avatar using an AvatarId and automatically attach it to your actor at runtime.
🚀 Features:
- Automatically loads a skeletal mesh from a glTF avatar asset
- Attaches the avatar to your actor using a SkeletalMeshComponent
- Supports assigning an animation blueprint
- Compatible with custom skeletons for advanced retargeting setups
- Blueprint and C++ compatible

---

## 🧩 Using PlayerZeroLoaderComponent (Blueprints)

The PlayerZeroLoaderComponent lets you load a Ready Player Me avatar in Blueprints with minimal setup. Add it to your actor, configure a few properties, and call LoadAvatar().

✅ 1. Add the Component

- Open your Blueprint actor (e.g. BP_Character, BP_Viewer).
- Click Add Component → search for PlayerZeroLoaderComponent.
- Name it something like AvatarLoader.

---
🧷 2. Set Up Required Properties

In the Details Panel of the AvatarLoader:

| Property              | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Avatar Id`           | The Ready Player Me avatar ID (**required**).                               |
| `Animation Blueprint` | *(Optional)* Assign an animation blueprint class to drive the avatar.       |
| `Target Skeleton`     | *(Optional)* If using retargeting, assign your target skeleton here.         |
| `Target Mesh Component` | *(Optional)* Mesh to replace. If left empty, one will be auto-detected.     |

--- 

▶️ 3. Load the Avatar

Call Load Avatar in your Blueprint, for example:
Example: In BeginPlay

**Event BeginPlay** → **Load Avatar**

Or tie it to a UI Button press, login event, etc.

---

📣 4. Respond to Load Completion

Bind to the On Avatar Load Complete event in the component to detect when the avatar has finished loading.

AvatarLoader → On Avatar Load Complete (Event)
→ Do something with the loaded mesh (e.g., play animation, show UI, etc.)

The event passes the loaded SkeletalMeshComponent as a parameter.
💡 Tips
- If Target Skeleton is set, the avatar mesh will be validated against it (you’ll see warnings if bones don’t match).
- If your actor has no SkeletalMeshComponent, one will be created and attached automatically.
- This component is non-ticking and lightweight.

## 📡 Async Actions in Player Zero SDK

The Player Zero SDK provides several async actions for loading and managing avatars in Unreal Engine. These actions can be used in Blueprints to handle various avatar-related tasks, such as loading an avatar, its image, metadata, or assets, and responding to success or failure events. Below are examples of how to use these async actions.

### 1. Loading Avatar Asset

Action: ULoadAvatarAssetAsyncAction
Use this action to load an avatar asset (GLTF) asynchronously.

- **On Success:** OnCompleted event is triggered with the loaded asset (UglTFRuntimeAsset).
- **On Failure:** OnFailed event is triggered if the load fails.

Examople Usage in Blueprint:


### 2. Loading Avatar GLB Data

Action: ULoadAvatarGlbDataAsyncAction
Use this action to load avatar data from a URL asynchronously.

- **On Success:** OnCompleted is triggered with the downloaded data.
- **On Failure:** OnFailed is triggered if the download fails.

### 3. Loading Avatar Image

Action: ULoadAvatarImageAsyncAction
Use this action to asynchronously load an avatar's image (e.g., thumbnail or preview).

- **On Success:** OnCompleted is triggered with the loaded texture.
- **On Failure:On Failure:** OnFailed is triggered if the image load fails.

### 4. Loading Avatar Metadata

Action: ULoadAvatarMetaDataAsyncAction
Use this action to load metadata for an avatar (e.g., character details).

- **On Success:** OnCompleted is triggered with the loaded metadata.
- **On Failure:** OnFailed is triggered if the metadata load fails.

### 5. Loading GLTF Data from Binary

Action: ULoadGltfFromDataAsyncAction
Use this action to load GLTF data from binary data asynchronously.

- **On Success:** OnCompleted is triggered with the loaded UglTFRuntimeAsset
- **On Failure:** If the load fails, the action does not trigger failure events directly.

### 6. Getting Avatar ID from Code

Action: UGetAvatarIdFromCodeAsyncAction
Use this action to get the Avatar ID from a shortcode.

- **On Success:** OnCompleted is triggered with the Avatar ID.
- **On Failure:** OnFailed is triggered if the shortcode is invalid.

### 💡 Tips for Using Async Actions

- **Ensure proper event handling:** Bind your success (OnCompleted) and failure (OnFailed) events to appropriate functions to handle different cases.
- **Load asynchronously:** Use the async actions to load avatars, images, and data in the background, preventing UI freezes or lag during runtime.
- **Optimize for performance:** For large avatar assets or images, consider preloading or loading in smaller chunks.
